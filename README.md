fork of normal sakuya ac for the purpose of rvb event. it uses the remelia api for
spawning ai aircrafts. see ``plugins/remelia_ai_test.py`` for one such example of a plugin
that can spawn an AI aircraft using standard vanilla YSFlight logic.

run remelia at port 7916 and join the game at port 7915 by default config to test it out.
and then type "/spawn" in chat to spawn the ai aircraft
